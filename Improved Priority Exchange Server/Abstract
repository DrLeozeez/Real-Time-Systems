Abstract— This paper is focused on the scheduling algorithm
of the improved priority exchange server. In complex systems, it
is important to meet deadlines, as there are a lot of processes
running at the same time, these processes need to be given
priorities in other to avoid system overloads, which could lead to
catastrophic occurrences in the system. In other to avoid these
overloads, we need to schedule the system, giving priorities to
tasks. In other to achieve an efficient scheduling system, we have
extensively analyzed the use of the improved priority exchange
server algorithm, which is a modification of the DPE server
(Dynamic Priority Exchange Server, explained further in this
paper), this is done by using the EDL scheduler (Earliest Deadline
Late, explained further in this paper) idle times. This led to the
increase in an efficient revamping policy of this server, and also
changed the dynamics of the scheduler which in turn allows
regular running of the system at its highest priority.
